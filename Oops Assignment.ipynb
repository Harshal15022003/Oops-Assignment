    "#Answer 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# #Functions are fundamental building blocks in programming that play a crucial role in writing efficient, readable, and maintainable code. Here’s why they are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Code Reusability**: Functions allow you to reuse code, which reduces redundancy. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can call the function wherever needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Modularity**: Functions help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable chunks. This modular approach makes it easier to understand, debug, and maintain code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Readability and Organization**: By encapsulating specific tasks within functions, code becomes more organized and readable. Functions with descriptive names tell you exactly what the code is doing, making it easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Abstraction**: Functions provide a level of abstraction, allowing programmers to use code without needing to understand the internal workings. This hides complexity and simplifies the use of complicated operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Maintainability**: Functions make maintaining and updating code easier. Changes can be made in a single function, and those changes will automatically apply wherever the function is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **Testing and Debugging**: Isolating code in functions makes testing easier. Individual functions can be tested independently, making debugging and error tracing more straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. **Parameterization**: Functions can accept parameters, allowing them to operate on different data inputs. This flexibility enables functions to perform a wide range of tasks based on the input provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. **Reduced Errors**: By minimizing code duplication and encapsulating logic within functions, the likelihood of introducing errors decreases. Bugs can be identified and corrected in a single function, which simplifies troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. **Scalability**: Functions facilitate scaling projects by enabling the addition of new features and functionalities without disrupting existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. **Memory Management**: In some programming languages, functions help manage memory by creating a scope for variables, which ensures that resources are used efficiently and released when no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overall, functions are essential for writing clean, efficient, and effective code, making them a cornerstone of programming."

    "#Answer 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# It seems like you're asking about the **iterator** function. In programming, particularly in Python, an iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through all the elements of a collection (like lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, etc.) without needing to know the underlying structure. Iterators provide a standard way of accessing elements sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Understanding Iterators**\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Definition**: An iterator is an object that implements two special methods: `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.\n",
    "#    - **`__iter__()`**: This method returns the iterator object itself and is called once to create an iterator object.\n",
    "#    - **`__next__()`**: This method returns the next item from the sequence each time it is called. If there are no more items, it raises a `StopIteration` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Purpose**: Iterators provide a way to access elements of a collection one at a time, making it easier to work with data sequentially. They are widely used in loops, such as `for` loops, to traverse through data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **How Iterators Work**:\n",
    "#    - The `iter()` function is used to convert an iterable (like a list) into an iterator.\n",
    "#    - The `next()` function retrieves the next item from the iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Example of Using an Iterator in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's a basic example demonstrating how an iterator works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# # Creating a list\n",
    "# my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Getting an iterator object from the list\n",
    "# my_iterator = iter(my_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Accessing elements using the iterator\n",
    "# print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
    "# print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 2\n",
    "# print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 3\n",
    "# print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 4\n",
    "# # next(my_iterator)  # Raises StopIteration since there are no more elements\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Key Concepts of Iterators:**\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Iterables vs. Iterators**:\n",
    "#    - An **iterable** is any object that can return an iterator, like lists, tuples, and strings.\n",
    "#    - An **iterator** is the object that does the actual traversing of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Memory Efficiency**: Iterators are memory-efficient because they generate items on the fly, rather than storing all elements at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Infinite Sequences**: Iterators can represent infinite sequences, such as iterating over the sequence of natural numbers, which isn’t feasible with traditional collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Customization**: You can create custom iterator objects by defining the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods within a class, allowing for highly flexible data traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Creating a Custom Iterator:**\n",
    "# Here's an example of a custom iterator class that generates even numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# class EvenNumbers:\n",
    "#     def __init__(self, limit):\n",
    "#         self.limit = limit\n",
    "#         self.current = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "#     def __iter__(self):\n",
    "#         return self\n",
    "\n",
    "#     def __next__(self):\n",
    "#         if self.current > self.limit:\n",
    "#             raise StopIteration\n",
    "#         else:\n",
    "#             even = self.current\n",
    "#             self.current += 2\n",
    "#             return even\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Using the custom iterator\n",
    "# even_numbers = EvenNumbers(10)\n",
    "# for num in even_numbers:\n",
    "#     print(num)  # Output: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Conclusion**\n",
    "# Iterators are powerful tools that allow you to efficiently traverse data, manage memory usage, and customize data flows within your programs. They are essential in Python programming, particularly for working with loops and generating sequences dynamically.\n",

    "#Generators in Python are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples, but they generate items on-the-fly using the `yield` statement, making them memory efficient for handling large datasets. Below is a code that uses a generator to produce squares of numbers from 1 to `n`:\n",

    "# for square in squares_generator:\n",
    "#     print(square)\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Explanation**:\n",
    "# - **Generator Function**: `generate_squares(n)` is defined as a generator function using the `yield` statement. Each call to `yield` pauses the function and sends back a value, resuming from that point on the next call.\n",
    "# - **Loop**: The `for` loop iterates from 1 to `n`, and for each number, it yields the square of the number (`i * i`).\n",
    "# - **Usage**: When called, the generator is used in a loop (`for square in squares_generator`), which retrieves each square value one by one, printing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Example Output**:\n",
    "# If `n = 10`, the output will be:\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "# 9\n",
    "# 16\n",
    "# 25\n",
    "# 36\n",
    "# 49\n",
    "# 64\n",
    "# 81\n",
    "# 100\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# #This generator approach is memory efficient and ideal for large values of `n`, as it computes squares one at a time rather than storing them all in memory."

    "\n",
    "# 1. **Public**:\n",
    "#    - **Definition**: Public members are accessible from outside the class. By default, all attributes and methods in Python are public.\n",

    "# ### **Explanation**:\n",
    "# - **Public Members**: No special prefix is used; these members can be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "# - **Protected Members**: A single underscore `_` is used to indicate that these members are intended for internal use and should not be accessed directly from outside the class, but they can be accessed by subclasses.\n",
    "# - **Private Members**: A double underscore `__` is used to make attributes or methods private. This triggers name mangling, where the name of the member is changed internally to include the class name, making it harder to access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Name Mangling**:\n",
    "# Python’s private members use name mangling to avoid accidental access from outside the class. For example, a private attribute `__value` in `MyClass` will be internally represented as `_MyClass__value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Benefits**:\n",
    "# - **Encapsulation**: Access modifiers help in hiding the internal state and protecting data integrity.\n",
    "# - **Control**: They allow you to control the level of access to class members, promoting better design and organization.\n",
    "# - **Flexibility**: While not enforced strictly, naming conventions provide a clear indication of how attributes and methods should be used, helping developers understand the intended use.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 1. **Base Class (Superclass)**:\n",
    "#    - The class whose attributes and methods are inherited by another class.\n",

    "# ### **Types of Inheritance**:\n",
    "\n",

    "#    - A subclass inherits from a single superclass.\n",
    "#    - Example: A class `Dog` inherits from a class `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Multiple Inheritance**:\n",
    "#    - A subclass inherits from more than one superclass.\n",
    "#    - Example: A class `FlyingDog` inherits from both `Dog` and `Bird`.\n",

    "# Method overriding in Python occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to modify or extend the behavior of methods inherited from its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how method overriding works in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Define a Superclass**: Create a base class (superclass) with a method that you want to be overridden.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    class Animal:\n",
    "#        def speak(self):\n",
    "#            return \"Some generic sound\"\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Define a Subclass**: Create a subclass that inherits from the superclass. In this subclass, redefine the method with the same name as in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "#        def speak(self):\n",
    "#            return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Method Overriding**: When you call the overridden method from an instance of the subclass, Python uses the method defined in the subclass rather than the one in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    my_dog = Dog()\n",
    "#    print(my_dog.speak())  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the `Dog` class overrides the `speak` method of the `Animal` class. Even though `Dog` inherits from `Animal`, calling `speak` on a `Dog` instance uses the `speak` method defined in `Dog`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Method Signature**: The method in the subclass must have the same name and signature (parameters) as the one in the superclass.\n",
    "# - **Calling Superclass Methods**: You can still call the superclass’s method from within the overridden method using `super()`, which is useful if you want to extend rather than completely replace the functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "#        def speak(self):\n",
    "#            return super().speak() + \" and Woof!\"\n",

    "# Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enhances code readability and reusability in several key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Unified Interface\n",
    "# Polymorphism allows different classes to be used interchangeably through a common interface or base class. This means that a single function or method can work with objects of different classes, as long as they adhere to the same interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Readability: Code that uses polymorphism often reads more intuitively because it abstracts away the specific details of the class types involved. For example, if you have a method that operates on a base class type, you don’t need to know the exact subclass type being passed; you only need to understand the methods available in the base class.\n",
    "# Reusability: You can write more generic code that can operate on any subclass instance of the base class. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to add new subclasses without modifying existing code.\n",
    "# 2. Encapsulation of Behavior\n",
    "# Polymorphism enables you to define a common interface while allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations. This encapsulates the behavior in the subclasses, keeping the details hidden from the user of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Readability: Users of the base class only need to understand the base class interface, not the details of how each subclass implements the methods. This simplifies the understanding of the code.\n",
    "# Reusability: New subclasses can be introduced with their own specific behaviors without altering the code that uses the base class, promoting code reuse.\n",
    "# 3. Simplified Code Maintenance\n",
    "# By using polymorphism, you centralize method behavior in the base class and delegate specific implementations to subclasses. This makes it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Readability: Maintaining and understanding the code becomes easier because the changes in subclass implementations do not affect the code that uses the base class.\n",
    "# Reusability: If you need to update or extend functionality, you can do so in the subclass without touching the existing base class or other subclasses, which helps in reusing and extending existing code."

    "# Python supports polymorphism through a concept known as duck typing, which is a key feature of the language's dynamic type system. Duck typing is a principle from the realm of programming languages that focuses on an object's behavior rather than its explicit type. The name comes from the saying, \"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### How Duck Typing Supports Polymorphism in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Behavior-Based Typing**: In Python, the type of an object is determined by its behavior (i.e., the methods and attributes it supports) rather than its explicit class or inheritance hierarchy. This means that as long as an object implements the required methods and behaves in a certain way, it can be used in place of any other object that expects that behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    class Bird:\n",
    "#        def make_sound(self):\n",
    "#            print(\"Tweet tweet\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#    class Dog:\n",
    "#        def make_sound(self):\n",
    "#            print(\"Woof woof\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#    def animal_sound(animal):\n",
    "#        animal.make_sound()\n",
    "\n",
    "#    bird = Bird()\n",
    "#    dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "#    animal_sound(bird)  # Output: Tweet tweet\n",
    "#    animal_sound(dog)   # Output: Woof woof\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#    In this example, `animal_sound` function can accept any object that has a `make_sound` method, regardless of its class. This is possible because Python uses duck typing: it checks if the object can perform the required action rather than checking its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Flexibility and Extensibility**: Duck typing allows for greater flexibility and extensibility. You can create new classes and objects that can be used interchangeably with existing code, as long as they adhere to the expected interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    class Cat:\n",
    "#        def make_sound(self):\n",
    "#            print(\"Meow meow\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#    cat = Cat()\n",
    "#    animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow meow\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#    The `Cat` class was not originally part of the design, but it can be used with the `animal_sound` function because it has the required `make_sound` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Avoiding Explicit Type Checks**: Python’s duck typing avoids the need for explicit type checks, which makes the code more general and reusable. You don't have to write conditional logic to handle different types of objects; instead, you rely on the objects adhering to a certain behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    def perform_action(obj):\n",
    "#        try:\n",
    "#            obj.perform()\n",
    "#        except AttributeError:\n",
    "#            print(\"Object does not support the 'perform' method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#    class Task:\n",
    "#        def perform(self):\n",
    "#            print(\"Task performed\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#    task = Task()\n",
    "#    perform_action(task)  # Output: Task performed\n",
    "\n",
    "#    class Job:\n",
    "#        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "#    job = Job()\n",
    "#    perform_action(job)  # Output: Object does not support the 'perform' method\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#    In this example, `perform_action` tries to call the `perform` method on the object. If the object does not support it, it handles the `AttributeError`, making the function robust to different object types.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Benefits of Duck Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Code Reusability**: Code can be written to operate on any objects that adhere to the expected interface, promoting reuse across different contexts.\n",
    "# - **Flexibility**: New classes and objects can be integrated without modifying existing code, as long as they support the necessary methods.\n",
    "# - **Simplicity**: It simplifies code by eliminating the need for extensive type checks and focusing on the behavior of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "# Duck typing allows Python to support polymorphism by focusing on what an object can do rather than what it is. This approach enables writing flexible, reusable, and maintainable code by treating objects according to their behavior rather than their explicit type."

    "# Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to the internal state of an object and only exposing a controlled interface to interact with that state. This helps to protect the integrity of the data and hide implementation details, making the code easier to maintain and less prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Key Concepts of Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Private Attributes and Methods**:\n",
    "#    - Python uses a convention to denote private attributes and methods by prefixing their names with an underscore (`_`). This is a weak form of encapsulation, indicating that these members are intended for internal use only.\n",
    "#    - For stronger encapsulation, you can use double underscores (`__`) to trigger name mangling, which makes the attribute name more unique and less accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Public Interface**:\n",
    "#    - The public interface of a class consists of methods and properties that are intended to be accessed and modified by users of the class. Encapsulation ensures that the internal implementation details are hidden and only accessible through these public methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Getter and Setter Methods**:\n",
    "#    - Getter and setter methods provide controlled access to private attributes. This allows you to validate or transform data before it is accessed or modified.\n",

    "#     def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "#         self.__name = name    # Private attribute\n",
    "#         self.__age = age      # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "#     def get_name(self):\n",

    "\n",
    "#     def introduce(self):\n",

    "# # print(person.__name)  # AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute '__name'\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Private Attributes**:\n",
    "#    - The attributes `__name` and `__age` are private due to the double underscore prefix. This indicates that these attributes should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Getter and Setter Methods**:\n",
    "#    - `get_name` and `set_name` methods provide controlled access to the `__name` attribute.\n",
    "#    - `get_age` and `set_age` methods provide controlled access to the `__age` attribute.\n",
    "#    - These methods include validation logic to ensure that the data being set is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Public Methods**:\n",
    "#    - The `introduce` method is a public method that uses the private attributes to generate a string introduction. This method demonstrates how encapsulation hides the internal details while providing a controlled way to interact with the object’s state.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Access Control**:\n",
    "#    - Direct access to private attributes from outside the class is restricted, which helps maintain the integrity of the object’s data and ensures that it can only be modified in controlled ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using private attributes and methods, providing controlled access through getter and setter methods, and maintaining a clear public interface. This approach helps protect the internal state of objects, hide implementation details, and promote robust and maintainable code."

    "\n",
    "# ### How Encapsulation Can Be Bypassed\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Name Mangling**:\n",
    "#    - Python uses name mangling to provide a weak form of encapsulation with double underscores (`__`). This changes the name of the attribute in a way that makes it harder to access but not impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    class Person:\n",
    "#        def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "#            self.__name = name\n",

    "#    print(person.__name)  # AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute '__name'\n",

    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    print(person._Person__name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Using `getattr`**:\n",
    "#    - Python provides the `getattr` function to access attributes dynamically, bypassing encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    class Person:\n",
    "#        def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "#            self.__name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "#    person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "#    print(getattr(person, '_Person__name'))  # Output: Alice\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Direct Access by Understanding Implementation**:\n",
    "#    - If you know the internal structure or naming conventions used in a class, you can access private attributes directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    class Person:\n",
    "#        def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "#            self.__name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "#    person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "#    # Directly accessing private attribute if the name is known\n",
    "#    print(person._Person__name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Modifying Class Internals**:\n",
    "#    - You can modify class internals using techniques like monkey patching, where you dynamically add or change attributes or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    class Person:\n",
    "#        def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "#            self.__name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "#    person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "#    # Adding an attribute dynamically\n",
    "#    person.__name = \"Bob\"\n",
    "#    print(person.__name)  # Output: Bob\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Why Encapsulation Is Still Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "# Even though encapsulation can be bypassed, it serves several important purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Prevents Accidental Modification**:\n",
    "#    - Encapsulation helps prevent accidental modifications and misuse of the internal state by making it less accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Encourages Proper Use**:\n",
    "#    - By hiding the internal implementation details, encapsulation encourages users of the class to interact with the object through a defined interface, which ensures that interactions are controlled and validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Maintains Integrity**:\n",
    "#    - Encapsulation helps maintain the integrity of the object’s state by providing controlled access and modification methods, which can include validation and other business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Improves Code Maintainability**:\n",
    "#    - Encapsulation hides implementation details and provides a clear interface, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "# While encapsulation in Python can be bypassed using techniques like name mangling, `getattr`, and direct access, encapsulation remains a valuable concept for promoting proper use of class interfaces, maintaining data integrity, and improving code maintainability. The flexibility in Python allows for controlled access while still providing the ability to bypass encapsulation if necessary."

    "# Encapsulation is one of the fundamental pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) because it helps to achieve several key goals in software design:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Data Hiding**: Encapsulation hides the internal state and implementation details of an object from the outside world. By exposing only what is necessary through public methods, it protects the object's internal state from unintended or harmful changes. This promotes a clear separation between an object's internal workings and its external interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Abstraction**: Encapsulation supports abstraction by allowing objects to be used through their public interfaces without needing to understand their internal complexities. This abstraction simplifies interactions with objects and makes code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Modularity**: Encapsulation helps in organizing and modularizing code. Each class or object encapsulates its data and behavior, making it a self-contained unit. This modularity makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain individual components of a software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Controlled Access**: By providing controlled access to an object's data through methods (getters and setters), encapsulation ensures that the data is accessed and modified in a controlled manner. This allows for validation and consistency checks before changes are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Flexibility and Maintainability**: Encapsulation allows changes to the internal implementation of a class without affecting other parts of the code that use the class. As long as the public interface remains consistent, internal changes can be made without impacting the overall system, which enhances flexibility and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **Increased Security**: By hiding the internal state and exposing only the necessary functionality, encapsulation helps to prevent unintended interference and misuse of an object's data. This helps in maintaining the integrity and security of the object's state.\n",

    "# 1. **Class Definition**:\n",
    "#    - `class Calculator`: Defines a class named `Calculator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Static Method**:\n",
    "#    - `@staticmethod`: This decorator is used to define a static method. Static methods do not require a class instance to be called and do not have access to `self` or `cls`.\n",
    "#    - `def odd(num1, num2)`: The static method `odd` takes two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and returns their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Method Call**:\n",
    "#    - You can call the static method directly on the class (`Calculator.odd(5, 7)`) without creating an instance of the `Calculator` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The static method `odd` is designed to perform a simple operation (addition in this case) and is independent of any instance-specific data."
